# telex-nlp

In this project, I attempt to build a small language model, trained on all the articles of the Hungarian news portal [telex.hu](https://telex.hu/), using a character-based tokenizer.


# Set up environment
The python environment is managed with [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/install). You can set up your environment with the following steps:

- Run `pipenv lock`to generate the `Pipfile.lock` which lists the version of your python packages.
- Run `pipenv install --dev` to actually create a virtual environment and install the python packages. The flag `--dev` allows to install the development packages (for linting, ...).
- Run `pipenv shell` to activate the virtual environment

# Run the DVC pipeline

The ML pipeline is managed with [DVC](https://dvc.org/), here are a few tips on how to use it:

- Run the complete pipeline: `dvc repro`
- Run a specific step of the pipeline with all its dependencies: `dvc repro <step_name>`
